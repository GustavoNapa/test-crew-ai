Dear Project Team, As The surgeon, I have identified a critical need for the completion of the codebase review in the '/codebase' folder by the Google Sheets Reader. This review is essential to gather the necessary information for analyzing areas of improvement or evolution in the project. To ensure the timely completion of this task, I have delegated the responsibility to the Google Sheets Reader with clear instructions and recommendations for expediting the review process. It is imperative that the Google Sheets Reader completes the review promptly and summarizes the key points for analysis. This information is crucial for providing strategic guidance and recommendations based on the project's current status and future goals. I recommend setting clear deadlines and providing any necessary support to facilitate the review process and prevent any delays that may impact the timeline for implementing improvements. As The surgeon, I am committed to delivering high-quality code and meeting project deadlines. By collaborating effectively with the Google Sheets Reader and the rest of the team, we can ensure the successful completion of the project and achieve our goals. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Best regards, [Your Name]

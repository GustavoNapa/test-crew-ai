To guarantee the quality and reliability of the project during testing, it is essential to follow a structured testing process. This includes creating comprehensive test cases covering all possible scenarios, conducting thorough regression testing to ensure new features do not impact existing functionality, performing performance testing to assess system response times under different conditions, and implementing security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is important to involve stakeholders in the testing process to gather feedback and ensure the final product meets their expectations.
